<h1>Use of AI in HealthCare  </h1>

<p>Artificial Intelligence has transformed our life. Hardly has any 
sector of life been left uneffected by it. Whether it is educaiton,
business, industry, military, judiciary, social networks, ecommerce
or scientific research studies none is going to be left untouched 
by the impact of AI.</p>
<p>The Aga Khan University Hospital has organized a conference 
on "Use and impact of AI on health care" to deliver latest trends
in AI and its integration into health management system.</p>
<p> Well known personalities from Computer Science and Medicine
will speak on the topic.</p>

<p>AI could help make healthcare operations more efficient
Healthcare organizations are using AI to improve the efficiency of
 all kinds of processes, from back-office tasks to patient care. 
The following are some examples of how AI could be used to benefit 
staff and patients:

Administrative workflow: Healthcare workers spend a lot of time doing 
paperwork and other administrative tasks. AI and automation can help
 perform many of those mundane tasks, freeing up employee time for
 other activities and giving them more face-to-face time with patients.
 For example, generative AI can help clinicians with note-taking and 
content summarization that can help keep medical records as thorough 
as possible. AI could also help with accurate coding and sharing of 
information between departments and billing.
Virtual nursing assistants: One study found that 64% of patients are 
comfortable with the use of AI for around-the-clock access to answers 
that support nurses provide. AI virtual nurse assistants—which are 
AI-powered chatbots, apps or other interfaces—can be used to help
 answer questions about medications, forward reports to doctors or
 surgeons and help patients schedule a visit with a physician. 
These sorts of routine tasks can help take work off the hands of 
clinical staff, who can then spend more time directly on patient care,
 where human judgment and interaction matter most.
Dosage error reduction: AI could be used to help identify errors in 
how a patient self-administers medications. One example comes from a 
study in Nature Medicine, which found that up to 70% of patients 
don’t take insulin as prescribed. An AI-powered tool that sits in 
the patient’s background (much like a Wi-Fi router) could be used to
 flag errors in how the patient administers an insulin pen or inhaler.
Less invasive surgeries: AI-enabled robots could be used to work 
around sensitive organs and tissues to help reduce blood loss,
 infection risk and post-surgery pain.
Fraud prevention: Fraud in the healthcare industry is enormous, at $380 billion/year, and raises the cost of consumers’ medical premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Implementing AI can help recognize unusual or suspicious patterns in insurance claims, such as billing for costly services or procedures not performed, unbundling (which is billing for the individual steps of a procedure as though they were separate procedures), and performing unnecessary tests to take advantage of insurance payments. </p>
