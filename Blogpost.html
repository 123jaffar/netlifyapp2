<h2>What is a Web Application?</h2>
<p>Web applications are software programs that are delivered over the

 World Wide Web. A web application is made up of web pages written 
in a language such as JavaScript, PHP, and ASP.NET with server-side
 code that manipulates data and services on the user's behalf.</p>

<p>They are built with data logic in mind. The application first needs 
to grab the data from a database (or some other resource) before it 

can determine what needs to be displayed and how it should look; this
 allows for more effective content. It's important to remember that
 web applications are not websites but web-based applications.</p>

<p>Examples of web applications are Google Apps, Amazon, and YouTube. 
On the other hand, examples of web pages are the viewing, contact, 
registration, and home page of any website. In addition, web 
applications are slightly different from progressive web applications.
 You must be wondering and wanting to know more about this fascinating 
term, progressive web applications.</p>

<p>What are progressive web applications?
Progressive Web Applications (PWA) are web applications that run on 
any
 browser, work offline, and can be installed on the user's mobile 
device or computer. They have a few functions; they allow users to
 create a home screen icon that launches the app and are mobile
 optimized. PWAs are also easier to use because of notifications,
 easy sharing options and enhanced security.</p>

<p>A progressive web application framework benefits from the latest
 technology to integrate the best mobile and web apps.</p>

Want to dive more into and understand web apps? Hold your breath as
 we get started with this blog.</p>

<h2>Advantages of a Web App over a Mobile App</h2>
<p>A web application and a mobile app are both applications that users 
can use to perform specific tasks, such as sending and receiving text
 messages or paying a bill. Still, the difference is this: web
applications run on a website, while mobile apps run on an app store.</p>


<p>What does your business need? A website or a web app? To find out
 more on the same and decide better, read our blog about web apps vs
 websites and analyze what your business needs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, web applications offer users more functionality than 
mobile applications. Features of a web application are more dynamic 
and,
 therefore, more appealing to the users than those of a mobile
 application. Plus, most of their website visitors are from PCs
 and tablets, with very few coming from mobile devices.</p>

<p>Features like online databases and video allow web apps to provide versatile functionality on multiple platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Some other features which set web applications apart from their counterparts include security, a user-friendly interface, and the ability to access widgets (small programs) via third-party developers.

To be precise, a web application is a software program used over a network 
such as the Internet, other than a local computer network, and a file system accessible through Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) over the Internet. A mobile app has limitations to what it can do because it runs locally on your mobile device and cannot be accessed from any other device or computer. Continue reading to learn how to get going!

Before getting started with web application development steps,
 let us look into the different types of web applications so that
 you have a better understanding and choose the one that best fits
 your needs.</p>

<h2>Different Types of Web Applications</h2>
<p>
Let's now categorize web applications according to their various types and features.

Static Web Application looks the same to everyone who visits. It doesn't update in real-time or store any information on you, the user.
Dynamic Web Applicationslook different to different users, even though they all share the same base code. They are updated in real-time and store information about the users. They generally run scripts and CSS to achieve their look.
E-commerce Web Applications allow you to buy a product or make a payment. They are generally built with PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails.
Multilingual Web Applications allows users to view multiple languages corresponding to them simultaneously.
Single-Page Web Applications act like a single webpage and can achieve almost everything traditional web applications can do. Some examples are Gmail and PayPal.
Multiple-Page Web Application reloads the entire page whenever the user switches to another one. Major examples include Facebook and Wikipedia.
After understanding the benefits and types of web applications, 
the next step is creating a development plan. We'll now examine
 how to build a web application from scratch.</p>
